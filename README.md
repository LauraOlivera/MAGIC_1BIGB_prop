# MAGIC_1BIGB_prop
A proposal for observation of 1BIGB catalog sources with the MAGIC telescopes

### BIGB_trial_single_night
Plotting the altitude of an object together with the Sun and Moon.

### BIGB_trial_year
Observability plots and observable hours of an object through a year-long period. Refinements on the consideration of the Moon position and brightness still need to be done.

### selecting_sources
Starting with the 150 sources of the 1BIGB selection of the 2WHSP catalogue, a pre-selection of 107 which have a high enough altitude to be considered is performed. Also study of the observable hours of those 107 and display of the results in a histogram.

### MAGIC_visibility
Defines a class of BIGB objects and a set of functions to peform the tasks of the notebooks above (obtain year-long data, plots, observable hours). **MAGIC_trial** can be used as an example to test it.
